# Seller Mobile App
Seller Mobile App is an app that has two different types of users: employees in various businesses and their customers. 

Customers use this app in order to see all available products/services and to create their order. Everytime they create a new order, employees that are logged in the app at that moment get a notification about it. In case a customer has some questions, he/she can call the employee by sending another notification.

Seller app gives employees access to all orders, list of all products/services offered by the business as well as their current availability in the store and existing tables/stores (depending on type of business). They can, as well, create and edit an order and send it to the cash register for processing.

This app is a part of our school project and communicates directly with [Cash Register Server](https://github.com/spusina1/CashRegisterServer) in order to get required information.
